# SourceGem Validator
A simple Node JS data validator  
This library is the continuation of @aeres-games/validator, following the organization name change.  
Validation results from this library alone are not being parsed into readable strings.  
To be able to get readable strings from validation, I recommend using the package @sourcegem/validation as it embeds this package and @sourcegem/translator, and provides a way to easily translate errors into readable strings.

## Installing
```
npm install @sourcegem/validator
```
